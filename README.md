# Weather Website
Programmed and hosted an appealing dynamic weather website showcasing the day, date, temperature, humidity, etc. with the help of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, infinityfree, and openweathermap. Implemented browser caching to improve the speed at which pages load and lower the cost of browsing.

# Strengths of the Website
The website boasts a simple UI that displays relevant weather information about the city 'Gloucestershire'. The page uses the localhost server to fetch data, which reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up access. Since the database is only updated once every 30 minutes, a last updated detail is available to alert users of the most recent update to the information they are seeing.
If a database and tables are absent, they are immediately built on the PHP server side. The old weather data is overwritten with the new weather data, preventing data duplication. This aids in reducing database size but may cause problems if the page ever needs to display historical weather information.
Finally, browser caching helps to speed up the load time and reduce the memory required.

# Weakness of the Website
It only supports one city i.e., 'Gloucestershire'. Therefore, it is also lacking a search bar. The background image is also static. 
The HTML structure is already quite informative but can be improved by adding different information such as precipitation, air quality index etc. Finally, this website relies heavily on the OpenWeatherMap API for its data. 
It also only shows the weather information for the given moment, it does not support displaying the weather status for the entire day or for the following week. 
The website is partially but not totally responsive, so how it appears will depend on the width and height of the device.
